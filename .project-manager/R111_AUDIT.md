# Interactive audit, 2026-10-06

Window: 08:13:55–20:13:55 UTC. Branch: `improvement/interactive-ux-audit-2026-10-06`.
Main fast-forwarded to `5c0d5cb`; no upstream merge, push or new PR.

## Live testing

- Root launched Ludomere on the real KDE desktop with X11 for scoped automated input.
  User reports wallet already unlocked. No passwords or tokens captured or shared with agents.
- Reproduced search deletion/hiding when enabling Installed; zero-result Home pane is blank.
  App-only screenshots retained privately under `/tmp/ludomere-r111/`.
- Enter the Gungeon Depot preparation failed before game transfer with a credential-service
  D-Bus disconnect. Desktop metadata checks report no standard Secret Service owner and KWallet
  disabled, despite its service owning a bus name. User was notified; wallet settings unchanged.
  Source review identifies redundant keyring reads during Depot preparation despite UI-held token.
- Missing configured installer/extras directories created explicitly by root; existing files untouched.
- Enter the Gungeon Windows offline installer (about 382 MB) downloaded through the detail action,
  automatic installation completed, and Play appeared without reopening details. Launch test started.
- Test game transfer budget used: approximately 0.383 GB so far (under40 GB). No intentional cloud
  deletion or real uninstall performed. Installation used the application's normal helper flow.

## Fixes

### P325 — retain search while changing library filters

- Preserve the query for boolean, language and metadata filters; keep search visible/enabled
  beside active chips. Preserve explicit Clear Filters behavior and view selection.
- Production change removes 20 lines from library/window; actual GTK regression exercises both
  input orders, all filter handler types, matching grid/sidebar counts, focus/widget identity,
  chip removal and Clear Filters without starting metadata workers or creating a real database.
- Independent UI review PASS. Focused private Broadway/DBus test PASS, formatting and all-target
  Clippy PASS. Commit717e8da and exact post-commit cargo build --locked PASS.

### P326 — show active downloads and retain full errors

- Featured transfer selection prefers active Depot/archive work over paused/failed history.
- Show full wrapped, selectable archive and Depot failures separately from changing ETA labels;
  retain Depot row errors through progress updates and refresh changed error text in the same state.
- Failed archive header action is labeled Retry download. Existing pause/resume/delete behavior
  and navigation are preserved.
- Independent source/UI review PASS. Two focused unit tests and two private GTK regressions PASS;
  formatting, all-target Clippy and cargo build --locked PASS. Fixtures prove control/text behavior;
  exhaustive visual clipping or real failure cases are not claimed from unmapped GTK widgets.

## Findings queued

- Explain zero-result Home searches rather than showing blank content.
- Downloads must feature active work before past failures and show featured error details.
- Depot cancellation needs confirmation, off-thread cleanup and terminal cleanup error feedback.
- Remove repeated keyring reads for already-authenticated Depot actions without weakening session
  revocation or storing credentials in serialized operation requests.
- Move managed-file summary database/stat work off GTK; batch repeated archive state reads.
- Avoid opening SQLite twice per game during cached metadata readiness load.
- Enable keyboard activation for game tiles; improve nested Genre list scroll discoverability.

Source findings are proposals until assigned, implemented and verified. Full interactive or game
coverage is not claimed from source review alone. Reports: `/tmp/ludomere-r111-{ui-critic,performance,reliability,depot-auth}.md`.
