# Ludomere

A native GOG library, download, and game manager for Linux.

Sign in to GOG to synchronize owned game names in batches of 50, followed by cover images and
sidebar icons acquired together. Icons do not require opening game details.
The bottom-left status identifies game-list, grid-image and requested metadata work. Cards show
queued/loading indicators, then an image, an unavailable message, or a visible failure. Partial
failures leave cached games usable and offer Retry; opening details shows a small indicator for
each requested section without waiting to enable Play or Download.
Footer Retry retries only failed covers and icons, keeping your current page. Dismiss hides the
notice without clearing failures; new failures appear again. Use Settings → Maintenance → Refresh
all online metadata for full synchronization. Downloads is centered in the footer, with account
status on the right. In the
screenshot viewer, Left and Right navigate with the same wraparound behavior as its arrow buttons.
Descriptions, screenshots, artwork and game information load when their detail view is opened.
Offline installer choices and Galaxy build information load independently when needed.
Empty screenshot sections show an unavailable message. Individual screenshots show loading or
failure states and can be retried without refreshing the whole game; failed images do not leave
navigation arrows over the next section.
Ludomere can install native Linux offline builds, Windows offline installers, or
ready-to-run Windows Galaxy builds. Downloads and installations can be paused, resumed after an
interruption, cancelled, and repaired from the unified Downloads page.
Completion refreshes the affected game's actions and library state without reopening its page.
Depot extraction and file verification show their own progress instead of a stalled download
counter. Batched journal checkpoints reduce repeated disk writes during extraction and resume.
Finishing setup pulses when the installer cannot report a percentage. Executable
discovery and saving cloud-save choices run in the background with visible activity and retryable
errors; closing executable selection prevents a late launch.
Transfer progress does not rescan downloaded files. If local-state inspection fails, Ludomere
keeps the previous state and reports the error; use **Manage → Refresh local state** to retry. Uninstall checks the
current downloaded files before offering optional cleanup, with a separate retry control.
Displayed sizes and rates use decimal byte units (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes).
Sidebar game names are green while running, blue while downloading or when an installed game/DLC
has a known update, white when installed, and grey otherwise, in that priority order. Idle known
updates show “Update available”; missing backups or newly owned DLC do not imply an update.
Right-click a library or collection game tile for the same actions as its sidebar context menu,
without opening the game's page. Favorite and Hide actions apply to the clicked game before the
menu closes. File-operation completion updates the open game's action in place.
Installation and launch failures retain their full diagnostic text in Notifications, with sensitive
URLs/credential fields redacted. **View error** expands the current game's failure, including a
recovered installation failure, without switching to Downloads; Resume remains a separate action.
The **Logs** tab shows saved native/Windows launch output with a live scrollable view, a saved-run
selector, **Copy**, **Refresh**, and **Open log folder**. Scrolling away or selecting text pauses
display updates; enable **Follow live output** to resume, or **Refresh** for a one-time update.
The viewer reads at most the latest 262.1 kB and lists the newest 100 runs, including legacy logs
among those runs. Complete logs
remain on disk without automatic pruning. Recognized URLs and credential fields are redacted in the
viewer and copied text; raw private log files may still contain sensitive game-generated output, so
review them before sharing. Existing installer/uninstaller log links remain available below.

For a new installation, Download opens one source chooser for available generation-two Windows
Depot builds, downloaded installers, and Linux or Windows offline installer versions. Selecting a
remote offline installer shows its Offline Installers destination in the same dialog. **Download
and install** saves every required part there, then automatically installs into the selected Game
Files library once all parts are complete. Failed source checks offer Retry; customized source
ordering is preserved, with Depot first by default. For an uninstalled game, the arrow beside
**Download** offers **Install from Offline Installer** to use complete, already-downloaded local
installer files. The primary action updates in place as downloads, installation, uninstallation,
and archive deletion change the game's state. The separate archive views remain available
for installers, patches, goodies and extras; their library chooser's **Download** action queues the
selected files directly. Installed Depot games compare their installed build with Depot metadata,
independently of offline installer backups.

Before transferring a Windows Depot game, Ludomere resolves its complete required dependency list
against GOG's official catalog. Missing or unsupported requirements stop preparation with details;
an offline installer remains an explicit alternative in the source chooser. Supported catalog components
include executable and MSI installers, game-local files, and the GOG setup interpreter. Downloaded
components are checksum-verified and cached for reuse, then verified again before setup. Required
components are part of the confirmed game installation; Proton and Steam Linux Runtime downloads
retain their separate confirmation controls.

The existing DirectX and supported Visual C++ compatibility recipes continue through Winetricks;
other supported dependencies use GOG's declared installer and arguments through UMU. Successful
setup is recorded for the selected prefix, dependency revision and installation method. Resume
retries unfinished work and reuses intact cached files; recreating a prefix requires setup again.
If an active launch detects a safely recoverable Windows setup failure, a **Repair Windows setup**
dialog opens. Confirm repair to retain the old environment as a backup; exact paths and diagnostics
are available under **Details**. If you have left the launch view, the notification area keeps a
repair action without opening a dialog over your current work.
Ludomere retains the old prefix, including its saves and settings; restoring individual save files
may require manual work, and the old registry is not copied into the new prefix. Game files and
preferences remain intact. Initialization alone is not a completed repair: **Continue setup** opens
the existing Repair flow to complete game setup, using the installed Depot build or an explicitly
chosen offline installer. Repair may download needed files. Until setup succeeds, later launches
offer to continue setup again, including after restarting Ludomere. The recovery dialog provides
**Open backup folder**; rebuilding never launches the game. Setup progress stays visible after
component confirmation, with download progress and completed component counts where available,
and a pulsing bar while an installer is running. **Stop setup** requests cancellation;
**Details** shows the current operation, available byte/component counts and the eight most recent
stage messages, including the final result. Repair preparation also shows activity while the
required files and components are being checked; no percentage is implied when none is available.
**Run in background** closes the dialog while work continues. Completion never reopens the dialog
or launches the game.
For Winetricks downloads, Ludomere preserves the trust selected by `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`
and `SSL_CERT_DIR`, translating readable host paths under `/etc` or `/usr` to the runtime's read-only
host mount. This also handles certificate variables added by `cargo run`. Other custom, relative or
empty settings stay unchanged; when no setting exists, Ludomere uses an existing host CA bundle.
TLS verification stays enabled. The installation log records the selected policy and variable names,
without their values. Curl's own configuration can also affect certificate selection.
A resolved dependency is not a guarantee that its installer or the game will work under Proton.
Failures keep the operation retryable and do not mark the game successfully installed.
If interrupted setup cannot be proven stopped, Resume and recovery refuse to change its files.
An interrupted launch with no saved process identity requires a reboot, not just restarting Ludomere.
For an unreadable operation journal, Uninstall → Prepare Recovery (choose the folder first if more
than one copy exists) can record a
safe recovery checkpoint. Restart the computer, then explicitly prepare recovery again: unchanged
damaged operation data is retained as a recovery copy before a separate file-reset confirmation.
It is never discarded automatically to bypass the process-safety check.

Adding a game library refreshes installed state and sidebar colors without opening each game.
Storage separates **Game Files**, **Offline Installers**, and **Goodies & Extras**. Each type supports
multiple directories and its own default. Only Game Files is required; optional types have no
implicit fallback. Unsafe library roots (including overlapping paths or inaccessible directories)
remain blocked with a reason. Extra root files, unrelated folders, trash directories and foreign
archives do not disable any library type. Partial or corrupt folders with Ludomere installation or
operation metadata are reported separately and do not disable other games in that Game Files library.
Storage lists affected folders with
Browse Files and, for recognized account games, repair and confirmed file-reset actions. Unmatched
folders can be inspected but are not adopted or deleted automatically.
Use separate, nonoverlapping roots, for example sibling `Games`, `Installers`, and `Extras`
directories. Game Files contains installed game directories and Ludomere's `.ludomere`
infrastructure. Archive roots use the managed `<game>/installer`, `<game>/patch`, or
`<game>/extra` category layout, with platform/language subdirectories when provided and
`<game>/dlc/<dlc>/…` for DLC. Installer components such as language packs belong with Offline
Installers. These types determine where Ludomere writes game data and downloads; existing unrelated
contents do not need to match the managed layout. No files are automatically moved or deleted.
Installation records are retained while a library is incompatible, and running games are not stopped.
Already indexed files in configured archive libraries are rematched as game/DLC metadata arrives,
using unambiguous filename, OS, language and known-size matches. Arbitrary flat folders are not
imported; previously unknown directories need an explicit index rebuild after their games are known.
Changing folders does not move files or erase other download roots' records and receipts.
Storage's **Move** action supports stopped native Linux games and reports progress and failures.
Windows moves are unavailable because their Proton prefixes also need migration; keep the existing
library or uninstall and reinstall into the new one. Pending installation work must finish or be
discarded before moving a game.
Uninstall keeps downloaded installers and goodies by default. Removing those files requires the
explicit, initially unchecked option in the uninstall confirmation. Game Properties → General also
provides separate **Delete Offline Installers** and **Delete Goodies & Extras** buttons, even when
the game is not installed. Each confirmation lists the exact managed files to delete from compatible
configured libraries; installed payloads, saves, and the other archive category remain intact.

Settings → Downloads includes automatic Depot updates (on) and superseded-installer cleanup (off).
Storage offers one **Keep downloaded files up to date** option per optional library type (both off).
These update existing copies in each configured root, including uninstalled games; they never start
an initial backup of all owned games. Per-game installer overrides remain available.
Checks run after library synchronization and every six
hours while signed in and online. **Check and queue updates** applies the same selected policies
immediately. **Game Properties → Updates** offers Inherit/On/Off controls for Depot updates,
existing installer backups, and old-installer cleanup, plus an optional Depot language override.
Changes save automatically for future checks without starting downloads. A blank per-game language
inherits the global default. Initial Depot downloads use this per-game language override, or the
global default when no override is set. Changing language preferences does not immediately change
existing installations.
Installed games keep **Play** as their main action when an update is available. When automatic
updates are off for that game's installation source, the arrow beside Play offers **Check for
Updates**. Checking does not queue anything or change the policy: confirm an offered Depot update
to download and apply it, or choose a library for an offline installer update download. Downloaded
installer updates remain a separate **Install update** action in the same menu.
The confirmation shows activity while preparing the update and closes after it is accepted.
Download, required-component and final setup progress then appear on the current game's detail
page; completed downloads do not imply setup is finished. Preparation failures stay in the dialog
for retry. Prefix recovery retains its separate repair dialog and progress flow.
Running or busy games are skipped. Opt-in cleanup moves eligible old managed installers to Trash
only after verified replacements exist; active work, install intents, extras and unmanaged files
are protected. Results appear in Downloads.
Trash cleanup requires space for a verified copy; failures keep the original files rather than
falling back to permanent deletion.

The lower-right Notifications button keeps the latest 200 results, warnings and errors from this
session in a readable history. Hover over it for the latest full message. Compact message text
expires after ten seconds; live progress remains separate and is not saved in history. Switching
accounts or signing out clears the history.

Manage → Hide game locally removes a title from the normal library, search and collections without
affecting its files or update policy. **Library → Show hidden** reveals it again for Unhide. Personal tags
support assignment/removal, global rename/delete, and any/all tag filters. These changes stay local.
The Achievements tab loads on first opening, keeps a separate cache per GOG account, and offers
Refresh with visible offline/error states. It shows unlock dates and any progress/rarity actually
returned by GOG; it does not write achievements or add achievement notifications. Game-side achievement support
continues to use Comet.

Supported installed Windows games expose remote-save inventory and **Export remote saves** in
their cloud settings. Exports keep the original remote paths and include a checksum manifest.
**Manage… → Delete selected…** requires typed confirmation, a verified recovery copy, and fresh
revision checks. Stop games and other cloud clients first: Ludomere cannot verify that GOG honors
atomic delete-if-unchanged requests, so an upload after the final recheck could be deleted without
recovery. Local saves remain unchanged; matching unchanged local files are not automatically
reuploaded unless you modify them, explicitly Force upload, or reset the profile.
Cloud recovery copies are preserved by full profile reset, while account-scoped synchronization
and deletion tracking are reset; preserved local saves can upload again afterward.

The one-time setup wizard welcomes you, then shows separate Game Files, Offline Installers,
Goodies & Extras, Proton choice, and Windows runtime steps. Valid edits save automatically; Next accepts the displayed
choice before advancing. Skip for now retains saved choices and leaves Finish setup
available; completed profiles are not automatically taken through setup again. Each library step
has one directory field and Browse button; existing defaults are prefilled and additional libraries
are preserved. Game Files also offers **Automatically update Depot builds** for installed Depot
games; it defaults on for new profiles and preserves an existing choice. This checkbox saves automatically
without starting downloads. Untouched optional archive suggestions are only accepted with Next;
Skip leaves their saved configuration unchanged. Invalid or empty edits do not replace valid saved paths.
Add further libraries afterward in Settings: expand Storage to choose Game Library, Offline Installers,
or Goodies & Extras. Game Display contains the separate display preferences.
New profiles suggest `~/Games/Ludomere/{games,installers,extras}`. Chosen new directories are created
after a valid edit or Next; incompatible selections remain visible for correction. Proton choices
show their full paths, including a selectable wrapping path below the version selector. Choosing a
version saves it automatically; Custom Proton Directory reveals the folder picker. Proton downloads
are offered when no valid existing versions are detected. The next step automatically checks the
selected Proton's Steam Linux Runtime and enables its download only when missing. Finish setup
before optional GOG sign-in opens in its own modal. Close the
sign-in modal to skip; already signed-in users do not need to sign in again. Failed saves keep your
edits in the wizard for retry. Skip or close the wizard to finish later, retaining valid edits;
Finish setup remains available without repeatedly opening it.
Closing the login window after GOG redirects does not itself mean sign-in succeeded: token exchange,
account verification and secure credential storage must finish first. Failures appear in Notifications
with stage-specific retry guidance; optional public-profile or avatar failures do not block login.
Each login window uses temporary browser data.
Explicit Proton selection and component-download actions save independently;
skipping does not undo those choices or completed downloads. Navigation waits for active component
work, while closing or skipping cancels it. Folder defaults are committed only by the final Save.
Ready Windows actions use saved defaults and per-game overrides after a background check. Missing
components show an actionable status; downloads still require an explicit choice in setup.

Install after downloading is selected by default. It installs a selected base-game installer and
compatible selected DLC using saved folder, language and compatibility choices after all required
downloads finish. Extras, patches and DLC-only selections only download. Uncheck it for downloads
only. Missing prerequisites leave a visible blocked installation in Downloads; resolve them in
Finish setup, then use Retry installation. Existing installations are preserved.
Extras starts unchecked for new profiles. Existing “Include extras by default” preferences remain
in effect and can still be changed in Settings.

Use each downloaded item's Delete action in Offline Installers to remove its archive files while
preserving installed payloads, saves and preferences.
Uninstall remains available for partial, failed and active operations. Healthy
idle installations keep their normal uninstall flow, with downloaded-file cleanup unchecked and
performed only after successful uninstall. Recovery removal first stops affected work, then removes
the exact game directories shown in its confirmation and resets operation state. Windows uninstall,
including recovery removal, also deletes the game's verified managed prefix. The confirmation lists
affected paths: saves and settings inside that prefix, and untracked files and saves inside removed
game directories, are deleted. External saves, other games' prefixes, Proton/runtime files, playtime
and Ludomere preferences are kept. Full profile reset continues to preserve installed games and their
prefixes. Downloaded installers and extras remain unless the unchecked cleanup option
is selected. Recovery can be cancelled, and unsafe paths or partial failures remain visible with a
fresh review/retry action. Browse Local Files remains available even when a game is incomplete or its
marker is damaged, and opens a single folder directly. Multiple copies offer a folder choice;
browsing from an exact-folder uninstall review opens that selected copy. If normal removal
cannot identify a healthy installation and only one safe game folder is available, the same dialog
prepares file-only removal with an explicit all-contents warning and one final confirmation.
Multiple copies retain a folder choice. This fallback preserves Windows prefixes; only the listed game
folder is reset. After successful recovery, Install Again opens the normal installation choices;
it never silently starts a new download.

## System requirements

**Arch Linux x86-64 is the supported platform.** The pacman package declares GTK4 4.14+,
libadwaita 1.5+, WebKitGTK API 6.0 at version 2.50+, GDK-Pixbuf, D-Bus, libsecret, xz,
Python, python-xlib, and python-urllib3. Arch supplies development headers with its library packages.
A graphical session and session D-Bus are needed to run the application. Login additionally needs
an unlocked Secret Service provider, such as GNOME Keyring or a compatible desktop keyring;
installing libsecret alone does not provide that service.
During explicit sign-in, Ludomere detects the session's standard Secret Service. If none is
running or activatable but KDE advertises its compatibility service, Ludomere requests normal
D-Bus activation and checks the standard interface again. It does not change wallet settings or
bypass a disabled API. Unavailable services, activation failures, denied wallet access, and
duplicate login entries have distinct safe errors; successful secure credential storage remains
required before sign-in completes.

The package includes a private [UMU Launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher)
1.4.4 and [Comet](https://github.com/imLinguin/comet) v0.3.2 with its Windows service helper.
Comet provides supported games' GOG Galaxy authentication, achievements, and related online
features. These helper binaries do not require a system `umu-launcher` installation.
They live under `/usr/lib/ludomere/`; source archives, checksums,
and licenses accompany the package.

Comet's proprietary GOG peer libraries are **not bundled**. The official, unmodified Comet helper
downloads and updates them automatically when online services start, following upstream behavior.
There is no separate Ludomere confirmation for those dependency downloads. Comet stores its
state and peer files under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/comet/state/comet/`.

Startup and manual checks fetch version metadata only. Installing a newer Comet binary requires
confirmation. Ludomere verifies the official stable release's Linux binary and Windows service
against GitHub's published SHA-256 digests before selecting them together. Updates live under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/comet/helpers`; pacman-owned files and the previous helper remain intact.
A newer packaged helper takes precedence over an older application-managed version. Real-game
Comet verification still requires the user's help.

Proton and the Steam Linux Runtime are **not bundled**. Choose an existing Proton installation or
accept an offered download. Windows games also need working graphics drivers and any required
32-bit Vulkan/OpenGL driver libraries. Native Linux installation and launch remain independent of
Proton and UMU, and use the normal Arch `/bin/sh`. The package is not an AppImage; Ubuntu and other
distributions are outside the current support commitment.

## Proton selection

Settings → Proton discovers native and Flatpak Steam installations, additional Steam libraries,
Heroic and Lutris Proton folders, and versions downloaded by Ludomere. This includes compatible
versions placed there by ProtonPlus. Choose folder supports other locations. External versions
are used in place and are never installed, updated, or deleted by Ludomere's download manager.

Selecting a version in Settings saves it automatically. Custom Proton Directory stays last and
reveals the folder picker only when selected; discovery alone never changes the saved default.
Proton downloads remain available below the selector. The bottom Steam Linux Runtime section
checks the saved Proton on opening or changing it and after successful downloads, with an explicit
download action only for a missing runtime. Detection and download errors remain retryable.

Automatic selection prefers the newest stable GE-Proton, then UMU-Proton, then Valve Proton.
The first automatically or manually chosen version becomes the saved application default;
installing a newer version elsewhere does not change it. Game settings can override that default
or return to inheriting it. These preferences survive uninstall. If a saved directory disappears,
choose a replacement: Ludomere does not silently switch versions.

Game Settings → Compatibility → DLL overrides provides per-game DLL names with Native, Builtin,
Native then Builtin, Builtin then Native, or Disabled load order. Valid rows save automatically for the next
Windows game launch; invalid drafts leave saved overrides unchanged. Removing a row restores existing
defaults. These preferences survive uninstall and prefix recreation. They do not download DLLs,
change the prefix registry, or affect native games and installer/setup commands. Explicit choices
override matching Ludomere defaults and incoming DLL selections; Proton can still apply its own
runtime compatibility policy. Each choice covers both Wine's bare and wildcard DLL-name keys so
an existing wildcard registry entry cannot defeat it for a qualified load. An exact path registry
entry or later runtime policy can still take precedence; no registry is rewritten.
**Reset DLL Overrides** clears only the current game's DLL choices after confirmation.
If Proton preferences cannot be read, **Reset Proton Preferences** offers to preserve the
unreadable file as a private recovery copy and reset all Proton selections and DLL overrides.
Games, prefixes, saves and installed runtimes stay intact; select a default Proton again afterward.
Unsafe or oversized preference files are refused without changing the original.
For an older prefix without a verified Ludomere recipe receipt, open the game's Compatibility
settings, add `xinput1_1`, `xinput1_2`, `xinput1_3`
and `xinput9_1_0`, select **Builtin** for each, wait for automatic saving, then restart the game. Remove those rows to
return to existing defaults. This is an explicit user choice, not a guarantee of controller support.

The download controls offer stable current and historical GE-Proton and UMU-Proton releases;
Valve Proton is discovery-only. Missing Proton or a required Steam Linux Runtime produces an offer
from a direct user action. Downloads show progress, support cancellation, verify publisher
checksums, and publish only completed installations. Retry the requested action after preparation.
Recovered/background operations fail with an actionable error instead of acquiring components or
opening dialogs. A private UMU adapter prevents its usual automatic component acquisition.

DirectX setup leaves XInput controller handling to Proton instead of installing native-only
XInput overrides. For an existing prefix with a matching Ludomere receipt for the old recipe,
game launches prefer Proton's builtins for the four affected XInput DLLs without changing the
prefix or its registry. Explicit inherited or per-game DLL choices take priority. The receipt
cannot distinguish later registry-only customization; use an explicit per-game choice to keep a
different XInput load order. Missing or unverifiable receipts do not trigger this correction;
no SDL/HID or host device settings change.
The managed `xinput1_3` correction is omitted when incoming `STEAM_COMPAT_CONFIG` or
`PROTON_ADD_CONFIG` requests `usenativexinput13`; explicit per-game DLL choices remain deliberate
overrides. This does not emulate Proton's full runtime policy or alter its configuration flags.

## Development

Rust **1.92 or later** is required by the locked dependencies. Install the local build requirements
on an up-to-date Arch system (this command changes your system; the build scripts do not):

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel rust pkgconf gtk4 libadwaita gdk-pixbuf2 webkitgtk-6.0 libsecret dbus xz python python-xlib python-urllib3
```

[`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) can provide the Rust toolchain instead of Arch's `rust` package.
With rustup, also install `rustfmt` and `clippy`. `base-devel` provides the C compiler, linker,
makepkg, and fakeroot; pkgconf locates the native development libraries. SQLite is bundled and
the HTTP client uses Rustls, so separate SQLite/OpenSSL development packages are not required.

Run directly from the repository:

```bash
cargo run
```

To exercise Windows support and Comet from a source checkout, first stage the pinned helpers into
an empty directory. This downloads only build-time helper assets, not Proton or a runtime:

```bash
python3 tools/prepare-helpers.py --destination target/helpers
cargo run
```

The environment overrides must be absolute paths. Use the staged UMU adapter, not a host UMU
executable, to retain the explicit-download policy. To stage again, choose another empty destination;
verified downloads are cached in `target/helper-downloads/`. Comet and its Windows service are
the unchanged official release binaries; helper preparation neither patches nor compiles Comet.
Debug builds also find the staged UMU adapter and Comet under `target/helpers` relative to their
executable, after explicit and installed helper paths. This works with `cargo run` or the debug
binary produced by `cargo build`. For custom staging directories, set `LUDOMERE_UMU_RUN` to the
adapter and `LUDOMERE_COMET_DIR` to the directory containing Comet, its Windows service and
`build.json`. An incomplete Comet directory is not a verified installation. Release builds use
the packaged helpers or explicit overrides.

The first run creates `~/.config/ludomere/config.toml`. The default Game Files library is
`~/Games/Ludomere/games`; Offline Installers and Goodies & Extras need explicit directories.
The executable is `ludomere`.

Settings → Account → **Factory Reset…** is available even while signed out. Confirmation closes
Ludomere and deletes its database, local login data, settings, favorites, tags, playtime, queue records,
cached metadata, images and logs. Cancel leaves everything unchanged. Games, downloaded files,
game prefixes and their saves, Proton versions, runtimes and cloud recovery copies stay intact.
Normal sign-out never resets the profile, including for an old saved reset-on-sign-out preference.
Sign-out revokes the account immediately, pauses downloads and interrupts setup safely; running
games continue. Interrupted operations remain recoverable after signing in. Factory Reset discards queue and
automatic-resume records after their writers stop, while keeping downloaded and installed files.
Reset retains a small identity receipt so incomplete game files remain recognizable without
restoring automatic resume. Older partial Depot folders can also be recognized when a surviving
journal matches their files. Unidentified folders and content in another library type do not block
library use; selecting an existing game folder still requires its game-specific safety checks.
If reset preparation cannot finish, the account stays signed out; use Factory Reset again to retry.
Progress and full error details appear beside the Factory Reset button. An unavailable system
credential store does not block local reset: its external login entry may remain, but a durable
signed-out marker keeps automatic login disabled until an explicit new sign-in succeeds.
Ordinary sign-out cleanup failures offer a retry in the account menu.
If an interrupted installation record could not be saved, its cleanup must finish before a new
sign-in can remove the sign-out barrier; this prevents old work from restarting under another account.
A reset already committed for process replacement offers Retry or Close without starting library
workers. Kept-running games cannot start further cloud synchronization or GOG online services
under the old account; a cloud request already sent cannot be recalled. The
next launch starts signed out with default settings; add any custom
game-library paths again to use their preserved installations.

Use isolated state during testing:

```bash
task_root="$(mktemp -d)"
XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$task_root/config" \
XDG_DATA_HOME="$task_root/data" \
XDG_CACHE_HOME="$task_root/cache" \
XDG_STATE_HOME="$task_root/state" \
cargo run
```

## Checks

`bash tools/check.sh` runs `cargo fmt --check`, Clippy with warnings denied, the complete Cargo test
suite, and the private UMU adapter tests. It gives tests disposable XDG configuration, data, cache,
state, and runtime directories and removes them afterward. It does not change `HOME` or use GOG
credentials. Tests need loopback TCP, subprocesses, pseudo-terminals, writable temporary storage,
and working GdkPixbuf loader IPC. Restricting these can cause environment failures even when the
dependencies are installed. Automated tests do not require a graphical display, a game, Proton,
UMU, or GOG credentials. Actual login and game testing require your normal desktop session.

Build an optimized binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Arch package and build container

```bash
python3 tools/build-package.py
```

This snapshots current product files (including uncommitted/new source files), verifies the local
source archive checksum, fetches locked Rust dependencies and checksum-pinned helpers, runs checks,
builds the release binary, and produces `dist/ludomere-*.pkg.tar.zst`. It also leaves the application
source archive and its SHA-256 file in `dist/`. It does not install the package. To create only the
source archive, add `--source-only`. `PKGBUILD` is a template: this script replaces its source checksum
placeholder before invoking makepkg. Do not run the template directly or use `git archive HEAD`
to package an edited checkout. Build caches stay beneath ignored `target/` and `dist/` directories.
The check script runs Rust tests serially because independent fixtures share process-wide
operation/account guards; concurrency regressions still exercise their own threads.

For a clean Arch build environment using Docker:

```bash
docker build --build-arg BUILD_UID="$(id -u)" --tag ludomere-arch --file tools/Containerfile tools
docker run --rm --init --volume "$PWD:/workspace" ludomere-arch bash -c 'bash tools/check.sh && python3 tools/build-package.py'
```

Rootless Podman can use the same commands with `podman` and `--userns=keep-id` on `run`.
Keep `--init`: process-control tests intentionally orphan child processes and need an init process
to reap them, just as a normal desktop does.
The image digest and dated Arch repository snapshot constrain the native environment; Cargo.lock
and helper checksums constrain downloaded sources. Update these pins deliberately for security
updates. This is a repeatable build recipe, not a claim of independently verified byte-identical
packages. Container runs need enough memory/disk for GTK/WebKit dependencies and Rust builds.
The GitHub Actions workflow runs these checks and uploads pacman/source artifacts; it does not
publish releases or install packages on the host. Its Ubuntu runner only hosts the Arch container.

## Guided game verification

Use a disposable test library and your own GOG login on Arch; do not share credentials or token
files. Automated tests do not establish these desktop/game checks:

1. Start the application, log in through WebKit, refresh the library, and restart to confirm keyring
   access. Verify a native Linux game can install and launch without selecting Proton.
2. Refresh Proton settings with versions installed by Steam/ProtonPlus and Heroic/Lutris if present.
   Confirm the saved default remains fixed, folder selection works, and a game override differs
   from the global default. Returning to “Use application default” must restore inheritance.
3. With no selection/discoverable version in a disposable profile, start a Windows action and open
   Finish setup from the missing-component status. Cancel one explicit download, retry, and select its completed version. If its Steam
   Linux Runtime is absent, accept the separate offer and retry the action.
4. Install and launch an owned Windows game, preferably once through an offline installer and once
   through Galaxy depots. Exercise update/repair, DLC, patch and uninstall controls where applicable.
   Verify the configured Proton is used and its preference survives uninstall. Temporarily move a
   disposable selected Proton directory to verify the replacement request without automatic fallback.
5. For a game known to support Comet, enable GOG online services and verify the expected online
   feature after upstream Comet prepares its peers. Confirm update checks fetch only metadata and
   display results in place; a Comet binary update needs confirmation, while Comet manages peer
   downloads and updates automatically. Cancel a binary update and confirm the old helper remains
   selected. Verify a completed update leaves the package-owned helper untouched.
   Confirm queued/recovered work never opens a dialog, changes page, or steals focus.
6. With a large library (500 or more cached products), reopen the app and search or select games
   while covers load. Open several detail pages quickly, then switch tabs: each section must keep
   its own loading/error state without replacing the selected page, scroll position or focus.
   Play should remain usable from a local installation; Download should open its chooser immediately.
   Open metadata filters and verify their incomplete/error indicator until missing metadata loads.
   Local filters remain available; unknown metadata stays visible until it can be evaluated. Retry
   a failed section and reopen a cached section to check reuse. Use a disposable profile for offline
   and sign-out-during-load checks; never reuse a private database for automated GUI fixtures.

Record the Arch package version, graphics driver, selected Proton, game/build, steps, and observed
result. Treat unavailable controls or unsupported game features as untested, not passing evidence.

## Current capabilities

- Native GOG authentication and owned-library synchronization
- Cached artwork grid and persistent game sidebar
- Search by title, slug, feature, or personal tag
- Search and filters for official tags, genres/themes, play modes, and store properties
- Metadata, offline installers, patches, extras, DLC, and changelogs
- Official GOG group/file identity with locally accumulated immutable download revisions
- Native Linux and Windows offline-installer installation
- Generation-two Windows Galaxy depot installation, updates, repair, DLC, and branch switching
- Chunk-level resumable depot downloads, including GOG small-files containers
- Parallel verification of existing depot files and destructive repair of managed files
- Windows installation and launch through UMU/Proton, with quiet registry and setup actions
- Comet-backed GOG Galaxy authentication for supported Windows games
- Unified download and installation queue with pause, resume, cancellation, speed history, and
  separate network and disk progress
- Configurable installation-source priority; the default is Windows Depot, Linux offline, then
  Windows offline, in one chooser that downloads all required installer parts before automatic
  installation; separate archive views download installers, patches, goodies and extras
- Multiple game libraries with library-owned installation markers and operation recovery journals
- Persistent favorites, local hiding and personal tags with global rename/delete and any/all filters
- Account-scoped, read-only achievements with cached offline access
- Inherited game-update, backup-download and installer-retention policies
- Offline browsing after the first successful synchronization

Galaxy installs use the newest available generation-two build on the selected branch. Master is
the default branch. If alternate branches are advertised, they can be selected from the game's
settings; successful protected-branch passwords are saved automatically. Generation-one Galaxy
builds are not currently supported.

Changing between Galaxy and offline installation sources is a full reinstall, not an in-place
conversion. Ludomere attempts to preserve known save locations during that transition and warns
before continuing when no save locations are known. Normal cloud-save conflict handling remains
responsible for reconciling cloud and local saves.

## Data locations

- Configuration: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ludomere/config.toml`
- Global Proton default and per-game overrides: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ludomere/proton.json`
- Downloaded Proton versions: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/proton/`
- Steam Linux Runtimes: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/umu/steamrt*/`
- Catalog metadata, preferences, activity, and the offline download queue:
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/library.sqlite3`
- Installation and runtime logs: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/installation-logs/` and
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/runtime-logs/`
- Replaceable artwork and screenshots: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ludomere/`
- Cloud recovery copies: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/cloud-save-backups/` and
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ludomere/cloud-save-deletion-recovery/`
- Offline installers, patches, and extras: the managed directory selected in Settings
- Installed games and their operation state: the selected game library

GOG credentials are stored through the desktop Secret Service. Access and refresh tokens are not
written to `config.toml` or the application database. Protected-branch passwords are encrypted in
SQLite with an account-bound key kept in the Secret Service. Comet receives tokens through a
private, per-session compatibility file that is removed when the game exits.

Each game library is self-describing. A completed installation stores its permanent marker beneath
the game directory; an active or interrupted operation stores its journal in the library control
directory:

```text
<library>/<game slug>/.ludomere/installation.json
<library>/.ludomere/staging/<game slug>.operation.json
<library>/.ludomere/staging/<game slug>.json
<library>/.ludomere/compatibility/<game slug>/
```

The operation files contain the information needed to resume or permanently cancel an interrupted
install without relying on SQLite. Depot payload is written directly into the final game directory;
temporary file parts remain beside the files they are building. A library scan can reconstruct
installed-game state from markers and plausible payloads if the application database is lost.

## Installation sources and storage

Settings controls the preferred order of Linux offline installers, Windows Galaxy builds, and
Windows offline installers. Rows can be reordered by dragging them or with the arrow buttons. A
choice made in the installation dialog applies only to that installation and does not change the
saved order. When more than one matching offline installer exists, the newest version is preferred.

Offline downloads use a plain, browsable layout. Base-game files live directly beneath their game
slug, while DLC is nested beneath its parent game:

```text
<managed download directory>/<game slug>/installer/...
<managed download directory>/<game slug>/patch/...
<managed download directory>/<game slug>/extra/...
<managed download directory>/<game slug>/dlc/<dlc slug>/installer/...
```

Galaxy depot installations are ready-made game trees rather than installer archives. Ludomere
downloads compressed chunks, verifies their GOG hashes, decompresses them into managed files, and
runs the repository's supported setup tasks afterward. Updates, repairs, DLC changes, and branch
switches reconcile the installed tree with the selected target manifests. Repair restores every
modified or corrupt managed file and leaves unknown files untouched.

Settings can change the managed directory and simultaneous-download limit, open the download
directory, clear replaceable image data, or request a complete online metadata refresh.

Developers can compare the compatibility manifest projection with Product API, Store API v2,
GamesDB, and content-system builds without writing application state:

```bash
cargo run -- --audit-gog-sources
```

The audit reads the existing keyring login and prints normalized counts only. It does not print
tokens or signed download links and does not write SQLite, cache, or download files.
